# Contributing to emitron

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Thanks for expressing an interest in contributing to the Kodeco app.

## Testing

Once you have the project open in Android Studio, select the `Emitron` scheme and use `Ctrl + Shift + C` to run the tests with coverage.

Don't forget to add tests for any new features you add or contribute to.

If you are fixing a single GitHub issue in particular, please add a test named `testGH<issue number>` to ensure that your fix is working. This will also help prevent regression.

Additionally, when creating pull requests, use the following naming scheme `EMA-XYZ-ticket-description` where:

- `EMA` represents the Emitron Android project
- `XYZ` is the ticket number
- `ticket-description` is usually the same as the ticket title, unless the title is confusing or too long.
- Example: `EMA-328-enable-app-usage-while-in-debug-mode`.
